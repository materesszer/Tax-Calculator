# Tax-Calculator
GUI-based tax calculator for my CS50 final project. Usage is very simple, just enter your monthly income(in any currency you want), check the deductions box if you have deductible items(and input the total value of them), then you need to check whether your country has a progressive or flat-tax system. Select the appropriate one and fill in the values appearing on the screen. You should see your results below the calculate button.
